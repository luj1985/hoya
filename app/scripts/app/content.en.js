Located at the end point of Xinguang Road Landscape Avenue, and directly facing Gaoxiang Port, the base is the turning position of Gaoxiang Port, and like the corner of on-land block, it is a famous open space close to port.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Design Demand</p><p>The plan is developed by three stages. The first stage takes the connecting facilities of railway station and ferry station as main body; the second stage takes the ferry station and bus transfer station and landscape engineering as main body, and the future third stage will take hydrophilic and commercial facilities as development goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Design Concept</p><p>Gaoxiong is masculine. The gentle breeze and strong sunshine reflect lazy urban rhythm, and show strong tropic amorous feelings. The design attempts to capture Gaoxiong’s wind and shadow, and to open the modern dialogue of wind and shadow through the medium of design module. Shadow tells its impish characters through its changes along with the passing of time, and wind proves its sentiment of placating the ground through its rhythm. Through the interpretation of dialogue, the design constructs Gaoxiong’s territorial space.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Design Method</p><p>Reflecting local axial line through landmark objects and marine light gallery: Continuing the axial line of Xinguang Road Landscape Avenue, the design constructs the “Marine Light Gallery” (third-stage project) horizontally continued on the ground, and the landmark rising slant from an angle of 45 degrees and pointing at the ocean. This landmark, 54m long, is similar to mast or derrick in terms of function and shape, and is the main member bar for supporting the structural system. Marine Light Gallery is a part of landscape design. With a full length of 60m, it gives priority to pond and spray fountain facilities. With cold aurora conduit buried at the bottom of pond, the Marine Light Gallery provides hydrophilic function at daytime, and strengthens the visual effect of axial line and shows interest and diversity by cooperating with the lighting of landmark at nighttime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Metaphorizing railway station, ferry station and their connecting facilities into Gaoxiong (Port) Industry Culture: Gaoxiong was established with industry; the large-scale industries such as shipbreaking, iron and steel, petrochemical, and shipbuilding, etc. have recorded Taiwan’s economic indicators, and established Gaoxiong Port City’s international status. The design attempts to exhibit the port city’s marine and industrial images through the elements such as steel skeleton, cable rope and membrane, etc. The station platform is 66m long, and extends as a part of landscapes. The light structure of three-wing semi-transparent ceiling shows the future sense of technology, and provides new space experience of the station. The station platform and the ferry station body are divided by <a name=\"OLE_LINK28\"></a>Xinguang Dapai into south and north sides. With the landmark as the centre of circle, steel cable is opened to support ten steel structures shaped as Chinese<a name=\"OLE_LINK29\"></a> character “人”, forming an arc-shaped “crossover” with external diameter of 45m and stretching over Xinguang Dapai. At the bottom of “Crossover”, the ferry station sets up office, waiting area, public toilet, and auxiliary commercial space (third-stage project), etc. The 6m wide platform channel at the top floor of Crossover is provided for pedestrians to overlook the landscapes of Gaoxiong Port; the area enclosed at the inner ring of the Crossover forms an activity plaza. In future, the steel rope above the plaza and the steel structure shaped as Chinese character “人” will be used to support the membrane structure, in order to provide the functions of sunshade and wind capture, and the modeling image of sail, and to echo with the design concept of provoking wind and shadow; in addition, other auxiliary facilities will create a harmonious urban place by combining with all the other landscape elements.&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p>"

Jinmen Winery producing Jinmen Kaoliang Spirit, established in 1953 and formerly named as Jiulongjiang Winery, has had a history of more than half a century. However, in the overall environment of increasing national income, gradual transformation of industrial structure and consumption habit, and globalization tide, traditional wine production industry is confronted with the deterioration of cost advantage, and has to develop service industry and transform to sightseeing winery with high value-added. As shown below, the overall objectives of the planning scheme are to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Plan long-term feasible overall development structure for the objective of transforming Jinning Factory into a sightseeing winery;</p><p>2. Reasonably plan, allocate and use partitions, and give concurrent consideration to the functions like sightseeing, production and office;</p><p>3. Arrange the whole area’s circulation uniformly, in order to exert the maximum benefits of the people, vehicle and material flows;</p><p>4.

Taking the 143m “Floating Wine Cup along the Winding Water” winding on the grassland as symbolic theme, the landscape axis connects the “Ushering Pond” and “Precious Moon and New Fountain” at both ends in axial direction. The Floating Wine Cup along the Winding Water is a literary quotation of wine culture, and as described by Wang Xizhi in the Preface to the Collection of Poetry at Lan Pavilion, it is a living ambit of refined scholars. In design, this concept is amplified and placed in this open landscape, and becomes a medium between human body and the nature, available for strolling about, running and jumping, staying, and sight-seeing, just as wine adding to the fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a public landscape at Jinmen Island, the project attempts to start with a pattern different from southern Fujian’s traditional style, and hopes to raise formal connotation to formal representation, so it adopts plentiful landscape elements giving priority to concept, such as geometric and solid structure, forming an overall style. For Jinmen, maybe “innovation” is also a sweet spring of energy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p> "

    "desc": "<h4>Preface</h4><p>The building is sourced from the competition of drawings themed on “Student Activity Center and Gymnasium” held by the university in 1999, and attracting the participation of Xinming Architects, Libinghui Architects, and our Architects. After competition of drawings, the school adjusted the building into a composite building “1,500-person professional performance hall and student activity center” upon service demand.</p><p>The school-running spirit of the University of Science and Technology rests with “constantly striving for perfection, and seeking the truth from facts”. The original intention of the planning and design is to provide a platform for communication of teachers and students! For the co-existence of many complicated factors such as the diversity of service functions, the abundance of spatial field, and the complexity of people flowing, etc. the building is expected to produce new communication place and make up the original deficiencies under the existing structure of campus environment.</p><p>The school party required the planning and design to be prudential. The board of directors and campus planning committee closely checked the design contents and achievements jointly. For complicated architectural functions and distinctive location relationship, it’s very difficult to integrate each party’s opinions. After 36 times of design conferences, alterations and adjustments in a period of 1.5 years, the scheme was finalized, and the project stepped into the implementation preparation stage. Around the corner of properly preparing contract-issuing documents and obtaining building license, the school party was forced to suspend bids invitation and construction proceeding in 2001 for the Ministry of Education’s regulation on the upper limit of private schools’ financing proportion, and so, original design contract was rescinded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Topic</p><p>In the summer of 2003, the school party notified its plan for recovery of this project, and negotiated to renew the original design contract with us, only that we shall correct and adjust some design contents by cooperating with demand, and changing “Performance Hall and Student Activity Center” to “Administrative Building and Multi-function Auditorium”. According to the school party’s consideration about functions, the building shall solve the deficiencies in the space of original administration management units, and meet the “multi-function” objective, such as the spaces for medium- and large-scale gatherings, students’ intra-curricular and extra-curricular activities, and the places required by new departments (performance art, leisure business management) for professional performance and indoor sports, etc.</p><p>Continuing the original intention of early-stage planning and design, the main masses consist of the administration building and multi-function hall, which are arranged according to local situations. The administration building is arranged in the shape L in plane, and in the mass, the public areas connected with vestibule, hall, platform and stairs are implanted, connecting each service area, and used as place for teachers and students’ activities, rest, and communication. The extension and folding relationship of its plane and vertical dimension is mutually applied with the energy-saving methods for wind introduction and lighting, activating the building life. Multi-function auditorium is a combined mass; the stage part shall meet the height of slings for lifting loads, while the auditoria and the court shall meet volleyball competition standard, and both parties shall be raised-ceiling and long-span space.</p><p>The outdoor part includes the exterior spaces taking fan-shaped theatre as the core, surrounding multiple plazas, channels and green spaces, and linking different topography elevations. They compose of landscapes jointly, and link up with the existing landscape system on the campus and the reconstructed and extended facilities in the entrance area, repairing the scenes in the gaps at the campus boundary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reverberation</p><p>From professional performance hall to multi-function auditorium, the drop rests with that, the design object is transformed from one extreme to the other extreme, namely from accurate and professional performance place to a place giving concurrent considerations to compound functions, such as gathering, lecture, music, drama, extension, and sports, etc. In terms of design conditions, there are substantially conflicts, such as spatial arrangement, visual angle of seats, illuminance of light source, reverberation time, material selection and allocation, and logistics management, etc.; after repeated analysis and discussion with the school party’s each utilization and management unit, we seemingly satisfy, but actually compromise to, the “multi-function” standard basically taking all things into consideration.</p><p>The school party’s board of directors and the design institute gave ardent prompts about the campus building style and spatial representation continuity. The selection of building form and material color belonged to the key items on which consultation and communication should be maintained in implementation process, in order to prevent the building from breaking away from the character and atmosphere of the existing campus environment.</p><p>The building was suspended at earlier stage; later the construction period was wasted for that the building was nearly designed over again; when the contract was actually issued at the end of 2004, the cost of building raw materials rose and maintained at a high position, so the building produced a very high operation and construction cost.</p><p>The project management was organized uniformly by the school party’s operation unit, in order to coordinate the complicated systems and interfaces of the school party’s representative, the design units of different subcontracted buildings, structures, and electromechanical facilities, etc., as well as outsourcing manufacturing supervision unit, and construction unit, etc. Thanks to pragmatic attitude, weekly worksite conference, and innumerous onsite coordination, all difficulties were overcome, and the project was completed and put into use 8 years later in the spring of 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p>"

    "desc": "<h4>Design proposition</h4><p>Fuhui building base is located on a sporadic industrial land in the downtown of Fengshan City, surrounded by intensively developed typical mixed residential and commercial streets on the outer-ring. Now there is no outstanding feature in the urban landscape; because it is near by the county government building, Fengshan High School, Weiwuying Park, Metro Orange Line and other important environmental zones, the owner hopes to enrich its utilization patterns and improve the utilization value of land by redefining it as “factory-run” building.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Overall concept</h4><p>In terms of design strategy, it will adopt low building coverage ratio (about 36%), limit the layer area so that each layer can be used as an independent unit, and construct the buildings up to nine-story height at the volume rate of 210% to leave more open space, reduce the shelter on the existing Kindergarten to the north, and provide the upper stories with better landscape view. The building orientation is facing to the south in line with the road in front of it. Because the west and south sides of the rectangular base are both T-junctions, most building structures are set on the west side to avoid Feng Shui taboo of front “road arrow”; the recession footpaths along the street are remained wide to join up with the traditional arcades at both street ends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Healthy building</h4><p>The vertical line, sharing and service facilities are arranged on the east side of the internal plane as more as possible, to facilitate maintenance and prolong the building life cycle. The balance is complete space to facilitate various demands of each utilization unit; all the directions will enjoy enough lighting and ventilation. It will reduce the direct heat exposure by vertical shading plates on the west, and shade sunshine from the windows by deep concave opening on the south. Because the concession of the open space and outer-ring streets make big distance from the adjacent buildings, the natural air convection inside is obvious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Form language</h4><p>The front shape is the outline of twin tower made up of symmetrical structure on both sides, emphasizing the vertical upward form. Contrasting with the most houses developed horizontally all over the streets located in surrounding environment, it stands out as an obvious target. Besides the main building, a two-story building in form of base is extended in the open space on the east to match and maintain the continuity of roadside building facade and urban space. On principle, the façade mostly follows classical pattern in three segments, based, house and roof. Detailed elements and styles are in texture with sense of order and stability and in simplified manner. Maybe it can relax the rambling&nbsp;and crowded urban structure at present and improve the spatial quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cultivate both fortune and wisdom</p><p>The words “fortune” and “wisdom” are from the owner’s life philosophy of “If one cultivates only fortune in spite of wisdom, more or less he will suffer misfortune even with the fortune; if one cultivates only wisdom in spite of fortune, sometimes he will be confused even with the wisdom”. During the learning process, they understood all people should often do charity to cultivate fortune, and at the same time cultivate wisdom to learn and detach from the cycle of life and death; &quot;Wisdom&quot; and &quot;fortune&quot;, like the two wings of a bird, and two wheels of a vehicle, are both indispensable. During the planning process of this case, influenced by the owner’s life philosophy, the general idea is to try to pursue the harmony between internal function and external appearance, taking into consideration both the building itself and the urban environment. In addition, during the period from design till supervision, it acquired great support and respect of the owner to the specialty. We want to express our gratitude by this opportunity.</p><p><br/></p> "

Richard Rogers does well in expressing spatial aesthetics with building structure and distinguishing building functions with vivid primary colors, and has outstanding detail design ability, innovative design tide and style.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Richard Rogers’ design concept for this building is to sublimate the enterprises’ internal self-examination to the macroscopic representation of environmental care through the microcosmic conflict between the grand building structure and the ocean. “External structure extension” and “internal seascape intake” are the spatial operation methods of this case, while the expressions of the building are originated from the waterfront atmosphere of base environment and the unique conditions of visual landscapes at the port, and this faces the challenge of the western exposure of sunlight. Considering sunlight angle, Richard Rogers designs louvered grille for external deep sunshade, in order to control the sunlight environment of the building, and concurrently meet the demand of appreciating seascape; in addition, the building structure is exposed, and the spaces like elevator, stairs, and service pipeline, etc. are arranged at the south and north sides of the building, in order to maintain the offices’ internal space integrity and service flexibility; the design of box-shaped structure extends (separates) the space in the form of enframed scenery to form an independent space for conference and exhibition, etc.; and even, fresh primary colors are used to express building functions, making the appearance full of building energy. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"OLE_LINK45\"></a>Hoya Architects &amp; Associates&#39; Design Execution</p><p>Hoya Architects &amp; Associates plays a role as domestic architect, undertakes and deepens Richard Rogers’ design and the development of details such as external wall, and structure ending, etc., and meanwhile, fulfills the execution of Chingfu Group’s electromechanical integration interface design for green building and intelligent building application:</p><p>1. External wall curtain adopts dual-layer titanized low-energy-consumption glass. It has a lower heat conduction efficiency than RC structure, and could effectively block the plentiful air conditioning loads induced by Taiwan’s subtropical climate.</p><p>2. The depth and angle of the grille sun visor on the appearance of the building are also simulatively calculated and designed with computer according to the solargraphy at the longitude and latitude of Taiwan.</p><p>3. The air conditioning system adopts VRV frequency-conversion cold-hot air system. with power consumption changing along with load, it could effectively lower the power demand for air conditioning. It’s estimated that, it could save around 40% power in comparison with common air conditioning system.</p><p>4. In terms of lighting system, LED lamps are adopted on the outside of building, and T5 high-efficiency lamps are used inside building. In addition, daylight illumination control system is set up at the west side of the building, making the best of the ambient natural daylighting, and effectively lowering the power consumption for lighting.</p><p>5. All the access control and electromechanical devices inside the building are taken into the monitoring system, which records the power consumption state of each device anytime in order to provide reference for future use and maintenance.</p><p>6. Double Roof design is adopted for the top layer of the building. On the top roof, grill sun visor and solar heat collection board are used for sunshade and solar power generation. A space is reserved for connection of solar power generated and municipal power supply, and for storage of solar power for public spaces and landscape lighting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides power-saving design, the building sets up rainwater recovery system in terms of water resource, and after being recycled and filtered, rainwater could be applied to outdoor and top-floor landscape spray irrigation system; in addition, small meteorological system is set up inside the building to ensure that the spray irrigation system doesn’t work in rainy days, in order to save water.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plentiful Parties&#39; Achievements</p><p>On Dec. 25, 2007, the president and vice president, together with the heads of the three allies, namely Kiribati, Belau, and Tuvalu in the South Pacific Region, attended the inauguration ceremony and cut the ribbon for the operation headquarters building of the private enterprise Chingfu Group in Gaoxiong for the first time. besides highly praising Chingfu Group as a successful model in diplomacy, all attendees appreciated the Group’s requirements on architectural landscapes and environmental ecology. When appreciating the building vocabularies coupling hardness with softness, such as the architectural image of exposed structure and suspension system, succinct and pragmatic flexible function allocation, convenient and high-efficiency public environment system, technological and energy-saving advanced building materials and equipment, humanistic headquarters image, internal and external connected and smooth visual space, and forward-looking planning concept, etc., we could feel abundant exquisite waterfront urban amorous feelings of Gaoxiong through spatial arrangement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p> "

It enjoys good ecological environment for being neighboring to Lotus Pond, Prophyta Park and Banping Mountain, and also, it has convenient traffic conditions for being bounded by Express Railway Station and No. Ten Gate of National Highway. Diwan University and Howare Hotel obtained operation right after appraisal, and jointly created a comprehensive place for leisure and entertainment, holiday and accommodation, and education and training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The existing architectural complex is used as Gaoxiong City Government Human Resources Development Bureau and its office, conference, training and accommodation spaces. The building structure doesn’t have great concave-convex changes, and the building materials seem to be cold, rigid, and non-interesting. The new building integrates the existing spaces, and rebuilds the architectural style; besides the original service functions, it adds the multi-function spaces like large exhibition hall and ball room, Chinese and Western restaurants, 211 guestrooms, and swimming pool, etc. In addition, it adds entrance hall, encloses outdoor atrium activity plaza, splits the personnel flow of accommodation, conference, business, and restaurant, etc., introduces the green of external ecology to internal public spaces, and thus creates the atmosphere of natural leisure and holiday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The additional construction and reconstruction are different from the operation of new construction design. It’s necessary to investigate the state and availability of original buildings, structures, and electromechanical equipment, etc., adjust the spatial functions and even make great changes by cooperating with the operation unit. For the problem consultation of existing buildings and the design proposition of regenerated spaces, heavy and complicated adjustments will be made, and this becomes the greatest challenge of this case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The design policy considers the two subjects “echo field environment” and “meeting operation orientation”, and figures the leisure building style. The construction methods are mainly as shown below:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adding masses, and reconstructing spatial structure</p><p>Add a layer of mass at the frontage of the original three-section compound, use it as the most appropriate hall in terms of function, and enclose the open plaza into an internal atrium in space, in order to distinguish the inside and outside; open a small quantity of windows externally and open a large-area window internally, in order to produce visible but non-transparent space interest, and change the spatial structure of original official organization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Renovating and internal court, and reactivating it for reutilization</p><p>Combining with the spatial elements like pond, hydrophyte, planting, platform, and activity plaza, etc., the internal atrium plaza could meet diversified service demands, such as outdoor gathering, celebration and wedding feast, etc.; meanwhile, as the extension of hall, it provides multi-layer spatial experiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sunken plaza presenting quiet beauty</p><p>Forming waterfall by continuing the pond of internal atrium plaza, the sunken plaza becomes a quiet and cozy non-closed outdoor space. It not only connects the upper and lower open spaces, but also has the visual field extended from the restaurant, and spreads the elegant aesthetic feeling of leisure here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Image and color suitable for ambient atmosphere</p><p>In order to integrate the external green environment of prophyta park, etc. and the full sunshine of South Taiwan, the overall rest image is figured by adopting white as the basic color, and emphasizing the lucidity and activity of leisure building. The design of nighttime lighting expresses the explicit effect of open field, and strives for the visual feeling at a longer distance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Modeling style, breaking restrictions for regeneration</p><p>The reconstruction of architectural image style is actually an important subject of the case. It not only embodies the connotation of culture and education, but also exhibits the characteristics of leisure hotel. However, restricted by the requirement that public properties shall avoid the reduction and loss of area, the public department doesn’t hope to change the existing building mass, so we could only unify the old vocabularies by applying external decoration materials and colors; in addition, for limited budget for appearance reconstruction, the case persists in the principle of not destroying original ceramic title, and regenerates the building style completely by applying paintings after using waterproof material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p>"

    "desc": "<h4>The origin and background of the plan</h4><p>A. The origin of the plan</p><p>The plan of Liudui Park, as a mechanism platform for cultural preservation and tourism exchange, is to recognize that the profound unadorned cultural connotation and enriched local landscape of Liudui is irreplaceable. Therefore, it will implement the &quot;Eco-Museum&quot; concept plan, by the promotion method of synchronizing both &quot;Core Park&quot; and &quot;Local Park&quot;, to actively develop and create the existing featured view of Hakka settlements. While Liudui Hakka Cultural Park, as a local show window to the outside world, will help the public to know Hakka and further investigate Liudui. The derivative positive economic effect is also a pushing force to promote local sustainable activation and lay a solid foundation for the township competitiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. Historical background</p><p>In the early period when the Hakka people came across the channel to Taiwan, their development mostly focused on the south region of Taiwan, and &quot;Liudui&quot; area is an important Hakka town in southern Taiwan. It is located on flat and wide Gaoping Plain which forms a completed scope of clustered area. The enriched Hakka cultural assets in Liudui area is “the best in Taiwan&quot; recognized by almost all Taiwan people. With the most ancient Hakka area, the most unmixed Hakka settlement, and the most outstanding Hakka customs, it is certainly the necessary place to experience Hakka culture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Concept of the design planning</p><p>A. Description of design concept</p><p>1. Infuse Liudui Hakka features into the landscape planning</p><p>Infuse the offering custom, life impression and featured buildings of Liudui Hakka people into the landscape planning, such as the plants with fragrant flowers used to make flower pots to worship the Earth God (refers to Hakka Jiuxiang), traditional Hakka buildings (smoke house, kitchen etc.), and unique agricultural planting (tobacco planting), to enrich the overall landscape depth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Create the combination of natural ecology and life landscape</p><p>The ancestor of Liudui people mostly exploited between plains and mountain forests, so the park planning takes rural scenery in Hakka villages as the landscape theme to show the characteristics of Hakka people’s simple life and combines it with modern lifestyles of health and sustainability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Dialogue between the traditional building landscape and Hakka imagist buildings</p><p>The rural area is set with smoke houses, ridge houses, kitchens and other traditional buildings, forming an interesting comparison of traditional and imagist Hakka villages with the umbrella stand area which takes &quot;umbrellas&quot; as the imagist buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B. Partition of the landscape planning development</p><p>1. Umbrella stand Hakka settlement landscape area</p><p>With the image of Mino paper umbrella, it shades Ahou Town. Hakka village industry and cultural settlement under the umbrella are planned as the main operating items. In order to reduce the energy consumption in the activity region under the umbrella, umbrella stand buildings are set with solar photoelectric plates combining with kinetic energy equipments, and other buildings under the umbrellas are also planed to set with recycle and environmental friendly building materials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Natural and rural landscape area</p><p>The life history of ancestors is exploiting between mountain forests and plains. Hakka people advocate naturalism and optimism. Matching rural and natural landscape, it creates the living environment Hakka people adopted from the nature. The rural area planning focuses on rice and tobacco cultivation, fruit trees and economic crops commonly found in Hakka villages, accompanied by traditional buildings such as smoke houses, kitchens and ridge houses etc. as an outdoor display area of cultural experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Jiuxiang Garden landscape area</p><p>Jiuxiang Garden built around the Earth God&nbsp;Altar derived from the living habit that Hakka people offer flower pots to worship the Earth God and the custom that they pray for new birth of boy babies. The landscape area set up in banded shape is just like woven printed fabric of Hakka landscape, and it associated cultural performance with the surrounding landscape by arranging outdoor performance space.</p><p><br/></p> "

At daytime, the shadow and concave-convex relationship caused by the holding-back of light boxes forms the interest like cheese blocks; at night time, the application of sandblast glass and white baking finish inside light boxes realizes the even projection and reflection of LED light sources, and produces relatively good rendering effect. Every time when the curtain of night droops, the dark gray shape of the buildings will gradually fade out in the dim light of night, while LED light boxes will start to be miraculously transformed into star-lights of different colors.</p><p>In addition, on the east-side elevation of the building, continuously vertical sun visor of four-floor height will have the effect of sunshade at daytime. Also, at night time, the lamps hidden at the back side of the sun visor will project blue cold light on the lateral opening of building. Under the projection of indirect lighting, the bevel sun visor will form blue sequential strip-shaped lamp belt, and form a point-surface contrast with the light points of LED light boxes.

    "desc": "<h4>Design Concept</h4><p>A. Jiaqi Building is designed by following the special value and concept which start from people, culture and certain place, and is designed for context based on the abovementioned complicated elements. The design of Jiaqi Building attempts to show the time and space characteristics of design and construction, balance economic benefit and environmental resources, look for and find out the most appropriate and decent building and planning solutions aiming at the existing site, climate, history, and building cases.</p><p>B. As concerning the architectural planning and design of Jiaqi Building, perplexed by the sunlight of neighboring residential districts, we strive for balance in diversified thoughts at design layer, and apply consistent design philosophy to provide solutions of different expression forms. By drawing upon all useful opinions from designers, and communicating with the owner, planning department, and other social vested interest holders, we assist the owner to make many decisions necessary for project promotion, and finally determine the comprehensive development theme of this case. Therefore, the design of Jiaqi Building doesn’t adopt a given or uniform label, but realizes creation in diversification, not only expresses individuals’ wisdom and skills, but also meets planning department’s key points in planning, owner’s wish, and team spirit, and makes the building style maintained at a stable level in the same region.</p><p>C. We believe that, the design concept of Jiaqi Building will produce a good value-added work. It not only reflects the value of designers’ labor, the value pursued by developer and constructor, and the value expected by users, but also enhances the overall value in broad sense of community, society and environment. We hope to meet the challenges of urban transition and building renovation through pursuit of such cultural value added, and embody the responsibility and occupational mission for history, culture, environment and society in the process of creation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Outdoor Characteristics</p><p>n&nbsp;&nbsp; Composition of building’s external spatial form: In order to lower and avoid the building masses’&nbsp; impact on and conflict with neighboring districts’ residential sunlight and daylighting, and building background landscapes at the largest degree, we adopt the composite components such as plate-type ceiling, etc., and the virtual-solid mass treatment method aiming at external composition of building; endow the regular external space forms with the mark of culture in the south region of the Yangtze River, make them rich in changes, reduce the over-blocking of neighboring districts, and form an echo with Jiangjun Mountain sceneries in terms of building context through the combination of neutral and stable external wall color and modern blocks and panels. The material for external wall of department store building gives priority to dry-hanging granite burnt plate, and that for residences gives priority to imitated stone-faced brick painting; and the window adopted is spray-paint aluminum alloy middle-hollow light-reflecting silvery blue glass window.</p><p>Indoor Characteristics</p><p>n&nbsp;&nbsp; Building space creation: As for architectural space creation, in the part of residence: the plane layout of connecting unit entrance floors is adopted; householders could enter each residential floor under the guide of the dominant vertical elevator traffic space on the ground floor; and public exchange platform is established through the transitional connection section among units. Om the part of department store: The two-floor department store side is organized from outdoor traffic circulation, connected with internal and vertical traffic, and obviously distinguished from residential part. In order to protect the utilization rate and strength of existing green space and land at the largest degree, we adopt the layout element form of connecting units in series for the whole building, and integrate the whole building form into the overall landscapes of Jiangjun Mountain and Cuiping Mountain based on meeting the standard sunlight and ventilation requirements of neighboring districts by means of cutting, connecting, adding and reducing, etc.</p><p><br/></p> "

Based on the idea of providing a sunshine office environment for every working personnel, the project creates a sunshine building for sustainable development and with each major office facing the south.</p><p>3. “Sustainable Development” Principle: According to the requirements of the planning for long-term development of work environment, we introduce the advanced concepts of ecological building and sustainable development to the design of this project, pay attention to energy conservation, environmental protection, and the use of related new technologies, new materials, and new equipment, in order to make the buildings truly meet the requirements of the new times.</p><p>4. “Paying Attention to Spatial Landscape Recreation” Principle: When reasonably organizing the flow of personnel and the flow of materials in the courtyard to surely make them smooth, concise, efficient, and interference-free, we make efforts to create harmonious and habitable internal and external space environments, establish brand-new and orderly external image of national tax, and make the national tax building become a green orderly station for national tax personnel and tax payers.</p><p><br/></p> "

Overall Layout</p><p>The objective of overall planning is to create a commercial complex which is full of cultural art, abundant and diversified, and orderly.</p><p>The land parcel for the base is trapezoidal, around 400m in the east-west direction, 190m wide in the south-north direction, and around 500m at local places, and covers a floor space of 119,070m2. According to the characteristics of the land parcel, the buildings are mainly arranged in pieces and connected with pedestrian street; at local land sections, internal street is formed through south-north layout, in order to enrich the spatial form of overall cultural art business street.</p><p>(1) Spatial Structure</p><p>From the south side, there are eight e-commerce buildings of 1-12 floors and art creation street businesses of 1-2 floors; to the north, there are in turn the Cultural New World Pedestrian of 1-3 floors; close to Tangjialingdong Road and Chengdong Road, cultural entertainment shopping, cinema, and fashion sports center of 1-4 floors, and tower building of 42 floors, forming a complete space sequence. At both ends of the sequence are independent, big-mass commercial flagship stores; the commercial masses in the middle are on the small side, and the flexible layout creates the changes interlaced inside and outside the business street; the one-stop layout of the commercial buildings at the Central Culture and Art Pedestrian Business Street creates the high tide of the whole sequence.</p><p>(2) Spatial Characteristics:</p><p>1) Connecting corridor: Like the tie, the connecting corridor integrates each independent commercial building into an organic integer; meanwhile, it links the commercial projects such as cultural entertainment shopping, cinema, fashion sports center, and cultural new world, etc. The combination of businesses with different characteristics will greatly enhance the overall competitiveness and activity of these businesses. The two-floor connecting corridor alternatively creates abundant and diversified spatial experiences inside and outside buildings, and it is not only a key commercial traffic artery, but also a landscape viewing platform.</p><p>2) Terrace and balcony: The business street of cultural new world is embodied at the creation of more good-quality and abundant outdoor activity spaces. The roof platform formed along the side of pedestrian street by making use of the different building heights, and the big terrace on ground floor are the places for tourists to get close to streetscapes, taste tea, enjoy the glorious moon, and appreciate cultural art atmosphere. The roof greening softens the indoor and outdoor transition and roof commerce platform; and it is the most sensitive place for people to experience the nature.</p><p>3) Cultural and art pedestrian street: The natural water system formed naturally along the east side of the base is the environmental resource to be used, and it introduces people to pedestrian street, and then enter the commercial bodies such as cultural entertainment shopping, cinema, fashion sports center and exhibition center, etc. The business forms give priority to restaurant, and take art and culture as assistance. The central round-shaped art plaza is arranged therein to enrich the outdoor activity spaces, and provides possibility for potential applications. The round shape integrates the applications such as performance stage, children adventure playground and holding of various celebration activities, etc.</p><p><br/></p> "
